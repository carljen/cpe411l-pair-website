## 📖 Project Description
This repository contains a simple, responsive portfolio website built to demonstrate collaborative software development workflows. The primary goal of this project is to simulate a professional engineering environment by strictly adhering to **GitHub Flow** standards.

We utilized a pair programming approach to ensure code quality and traceability. Every change in this repository was implemented through:
* **Feature Branching:** No direct pushes to the main branch.
* **Pull Requests:** All features were merged via PRs with peer reviews.
* **Version Control:** A clear commit history documenting the development process.

## ✨ Features
* **Responsive Design:** Fully compatible with mobile and desktop views using CSS Media Queries.
* **Clean UI:** Professional layout with a dark-themed header and card-based project showcase.
* **Internal Styling:** Optimized single-file structure for lightweight performance.
* **Navigation:** Functional smooth scrolling to About, Projects, and Contact sections.
