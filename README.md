## 📖 Project Description
This repository contains a simple, responsive portfolio website built to demonstrate collaborative software development workflows. [cite_start]The primary goal of this project is to simulate a professional engineering environment by strictly adhering to **GitHub Flow** standards[cite: 4, 19].

We utilized a pair programming approach to ensure code quality and traceability. Every change in this repository was implemented through:
* [cite_start]**Feature Branching:** No direct pushes to the main branch[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Pull Requests:** All features were merged via PRs with peer reviews[cite: 23, 24].
* [cite_start]**Version Control:** A clear commit history documenting the development process[cite: 30].

## ✨ Features
* [cite_start]**Responsive Design:** Fully compatible with mobile and desktop views using CSS Media Queries[cite: 9].
* **Clean UI:** Professional layout with a dark-themed header and card-based project showcase.
* **Internal Styling:** Optimized single-file structure for lightweight performance.
* **Navigation:** Functional smooth scrolling to About, Projects, and Contact sections.
